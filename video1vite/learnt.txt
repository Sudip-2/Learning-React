Disected a react folder 
in react js func or components you cannot return more than one element so everyone wraps around multiple element in one div then fragments are created <></>

react converts jsx into js object using React.createElement then takes into virtual dom to then real dom then it shows html

jsx is used for ui in descriptive way its basically HTML-Like Syntax in JavaScript


jsx can take expression like 2+2 not control statement if else etc
